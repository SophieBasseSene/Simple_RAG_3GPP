And when I saw this beautiful French cookbook at the library last week, I knew exactly what I wanted to make.\\n\\nThis dish is called Coq au Vin (pronounced “kok oh vEEN”). It’s a classic French dish that translates to “rooster in wine”. The dish traditionally uses chicken, but I decided to use turkey instead because it’s what I had on hand.\\n\\nThe dish is made by braising the meat in red wine until it’s tender and flavorful. The result is a rich, savory sauce that’s perfect over rice or noodles.\\n\\nI served mine over brown rice, but you could also serve it over egg noodles or mashed potatoes.\\n\\nHere’s how to make it:\\n\\nIngredients:\\n\\n1 lb boneless turkey breast, cut into bite-sized pieces\\n\\n2 tbsp olive oil\\n\\n1 large onion, chopped\\n\\n4 cloves garlic, minced\\n\\n8 oz mushrooms, sliced\\n\\n1 cup dry red wine\\n\\n1 cup beef broth\\n\\n1 bay leaf\\n\\n1 tsp dried thyme\\n\\n1 tsp salt\\n\\n1/2 tsp black pepper\\n\\n2 tbsp cornstarch\\n\\n2 tbsp cold water\\n\\nInstructions:\\n\\n1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the turkey and cook until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.\\n\\n2. In the same pan, add the onions and garlic. Cook until the onions are translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms and continue cooking until they are softened, about 5 minutes.\\n\\n3. Pour in the red wine and deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the beef broth, bay leaf, thyme, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and let cook for 10 minutes.\\n\\n4. Return the turkey to the pan and let simmer for an additional 15-20 minutes'}]\n",

      "The \"aa\" field in Tables 1 and 2 represents the series number, which indicates the type of technology or release. In the given context, \"aa\" ranges from 21 to 59 and denotes specifications for both 2G (GSM) and 3G systems, as well as technical modifications or new specifications. The \"bbb\" field is a sub-number within each series that further distinguishes between different specifications within the same series. For example, in the range 21 to 39, there may be multiple specifications with the same \"aa\" value but different \"bbb\" values. This system allows for better organization and tracking of specifications over time, as older versions may still exist in parallel with newer ones for a given release.\n",

      "Assistant's Response:\n",
      "In summary, the \"aa\" field in Tables 1 and 2 represents the category of the specification, with different ranges indicating different types of specifications. Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"aa\" in the range 21 to 39: These specifications apply to pre-Release-4 GSM systems and are maintained by 3GPP. They continue to be propagated beyond Release 1999.\n",
      "- \"aa\" in the range 41 to 59: These specifications are direct equivalents to earlier GSM specifications for releases 4 or later.\n",
      "- \"aa.1bb\": These specifications are either derived from earlier 2G (GSM) specifications with technical modifications or are new specifications.\n",
      "- \"aa.21 to.39\": For most specifications in this range for a given release, there is a corresponding GSM specification numbered [aa.-xa020].[bbb-xa0100] that exists for earlier releases.\n",
      "- \"aa.41 to.59\": These are new GSM specifications for release 4 or later.\n",
      "- \"aa.8bb\": These are technical reports not intended for publication, which are working documents of 3GPP groups not intended to be transposed into publications by partner organizations.\n",
      "- \"aa.9bb\": These are technical reports intended for publication, which are distinct from those of the \"aa.8bb\" series.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"bbb\" field in Tables 1 and 2 represents the specific content or aspect of the specification, and its value depends on the specific category represented by the \"aa\" field. The tables provide specific allocations within certain series.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the numbering scheme for 3GPP specifications and technical reports is designed to ensure strict enforcement of certain provisions while allowing for flexibility in other areas. The lists and databases mentioned in section 7 of the context provide important management and tracking information for 3GPP specifications and related activities.\n"

      "Ground truth générée: A technical specification is a document that describes a technology or aspect of a technology, while a standard is a specification that has been approved by a standards organization. Normalization plays a role in both by ensuring consistency and compatibility across similar technologies. In the case of a technical specification, normalization may involve aligning with existing standards or best practices to ensure interoperability and reduce redundancy. Once a technical specification has been approved as a standard, it becomes a requirement for all implementations of that technology, promoting consistency and reducing fragmentation in the market. This helps to ensure that products and services based on the standard can be easily integrated into larger systems and networks, improving overall efficiency and reliability.\n",
      "Réponse générée par RAG: In simple terms, a technical specification is a detailed document outlining the technical aspects of a particular technology or feature, while a standard is a widely accepted and recognized set of rules or guidelines governing a specific industry or field. Normalization plays a crucial role in both, as it involves consolidating similar technologies into a single standard, making them more efficient, cost-effective, and interoperable. While a technical specification provides a detailed description of a technology, a standard ensures its widespread adoption and implementation across various organizations and industries. The process of normalization helps in reducing redundancy, minimizing costs, and promoting consistency in technology development and usage.\n",

      "Answers : ['The term \"freeze\" in the context of specification development refers to a stage in the development process where no further changes to the specification are allowed except for priority 1 and urgent issues. This means that once a specification is frozen, any change requests (CRs) related to it can only align the specification with the agreed functionality of the release or ensure internal consistency within the specification itself. Frozen specifications are part of a release candidate, which has passed all required tests and reviews and is ready for publication. After publication, the specification becomes released and enters its final status.', 'In simple terms, a technical specification is a detailed document outlining the technical aspects of a particular technology or feature, while a standard is a widely accepted and recognized set of rules or guidelines governing a specific industry or field. Normalization plays a crucial role in both, as it involves consolidating similar technologies into a single standard, making them more efficient, cost-effective, and interoperable.

Frozen specifications are part of a release candidate, which has passed all required tests and reviews and is ready for publication. After publication, the specification becomes released and enters its final status.\n",

      "Your Question: What is the difference between a technical specification and a standard, and how does normalization play a role in both?\n",
      "Answer: In simple terms, a technical specification is a detailed document outlining the technical aspects of a particular technology or feature, while a standard is a widely accepted and recognized set of rules or guidelines governing a specific industry or field. Normalization plays a crucial role in both, as it involves consolidating similar technologies into a single standard, making them more efficient, cost-effective, and interoperable. While a technical specification provides a detailed description of a technology, a standard ensures its widespread adoption and implementation across various organizations and industries. The process of normalization helps in reducing redundancy, minimizing costs, and promoting consistency in technology development and usage.\n",
      "Contexts: ['early implementation: implementation of a particular feature on a platform of a release earlier than the release that contains the feature.\\n\\n\\n\\nfeature: new or substantially enhanced functionality which represents added value to the existing system.\\n\\nfrozen: release status in which only essential corrections are permitted.\\n\\nfunctionality: normative text contained in one or more Technical Specifications, corresponding either to a feature or to some portion of a feature. \\n\\ngroup: TSG or TSG sub-group.\\n\\nmajor version: For version x.y.z of a specification, x is called the major version.\\n\\nExample:\\tFor version 3.2.0 of a specification, the major version is 3.\\n\\nMobile Competence Centre (MCC): The permanent secretariat, or support team, of 3GPP.']\n",
      "Ground Truth: A technical specification is a document that describes a technology or aspect of a technology, while a standard is a specification that has been approved by a standards organization. Normalization plays a role in both by ensuring consistency and compatibility across similar technologies. In the case of a technical specification, normalization may involve aligning with existing standards or best practices to ensure interoperability and reduce redundancy. Once a technical specification has been approved as a standard, it becomes a requirement for all implementations of that technology, promoting consistency and reducing fragmentation in the market. This helps to ensure that products and services based on the standard can be easily integrated into larger systems and networks, improving overall efficiency and reliability.\n",
